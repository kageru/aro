<h1>Query Syntax</h1>
The syntax is heavily inspired by <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/syntax">Scryfall</a> with some changes and a lot fewer features.<br/>
You can filter different characteristics of a card and combine multiple filters into one search. See below for examples.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Search fields</h2>
Currently supported search fields are:
<ul>
  <li><code>atk</code> and <code>def</code>.
  <li>The <code>level</code> (or <code>l</code>) of a monster. Note that the search does not distinguish between level and rank, so <a href="/?q=l%3A4"><code>l:4</code></a> will return all monsters that are either level 4 or rank 4.</li>
  <li>The <code>linkrating</code> (or <code>lr</code>) of a monster.</li>
  <li>The <code>type</code> (or <code>t</code>) of a card (this is both “Spell”, “Trap”, “Effect”, “XYZ”, etc. but also “Pyro”, “Insect”, “Winged-Beast”, etc. for monsters and “quick-play”, “counter”, or “normal” for Spells/Traps).</li>
  <li>The <code>attribute</code> (or <code>attr</code> or <code>a</code>) of a card. This is “Light”, “Dark”, “Earth”, etc.</li>
  <li>The <code>genesys</code> points (or <code>g</code> or <code>gen</code>) of a card.</li>
  <li>The <code>text</code> (or <code>effect</code>, <code>eff</code>, <code>e</code>, or <code>o</code>) of a card. This is either the effect or flavor text (for normal monsters). For pendulum cards, this searches in both pendulum and monster effects. The <code>o</code> alias is to help my muscle memory coming from Scryfall.</li>
  <li>The <code>set</code> (or <code>s</code>) a card was printed in. This considers all printings, not just the original, and uses the set code (e.g. <code>ioc</code> for Invasion of Chaos or <code>pote</code> for Power of the Elements).</li>
  <li>The <code>year</code> (or <code>y</code>) a card was <em>first</em> printed in the TCG.
  <li>The <code>copies</code> (or <code>legal</code>) you’re allowed to play according to the current TCG banlist.</li>
  <li>The <code>price</code> (or <code>p</code>) of the cheapest version of the card <em>in cents</em>. This will use tcgplayer or cardmarket, whichever is lower. Results can be off because of OCG cards on the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to filter for multiple values at once, e.g. <code>level:3|6|9</code> to find all cards that are level 3, 6, or 9.</p>
<p>Searching by regex is supported. Simply put the search string in slashes, i.e. <a href="/?q=o%3A%2Fdraw+%5Cd%2B+card%2F"><code>o:/draw \d+ card/</code></a>. No regex flags can be passed, but i (case-insensitive) is enabled by default.</p>
<p>Anything not associated with a search field is interpreted as a search in the card name, so <a href="/?q=l%3A4+utopia"><code>l:4 utopia</code></a> will show all level/rank 4 monsters with “Utopia” in their name. <code>name:</code> can be used to explicitly search for names, which is necessary when searching by Regex.</p>
<p>If your search contains spaces (e.g. searching for an effect that says “destroy that target”), the text must be quoted like <code>effect:"destroy that target"</code>.</p>
<p>Note that all fields are case-insensitive, so <code>type:NORMAL</code> is the same as <code>type:Normal</code> or <code>type:normal</code>.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Search operators</h2>
The following search operators are supported:
<ul>
  <li>Equality (<code>:</code>, <code>=</code>, or <code>==</code>) checks if the value is equal to your search. For the effect, this checks if your search is contained in the field, so <a href="/?q=effect%3Abanish"><code>effect:banish</code></a> will show all cards that have the word “banish” anywhere in their text.</li>
  <li>Inequality (<code>!=</code>) checks if the value is not equal to your search. For text fields, this return cards that do not contain the word you searched.</li>
  <li>Comparisons (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>) check if the value is less than, greater than, less than or equal, and greater than or equal to your search. <a href="/?q=atk%3E%3D4000"><code>atk&gt;=4000</code></a> will show all cards with an ATK of at least 4000. These operators do not work for text fields.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All Fire monsters with exactly 200 DEF: <a href="/?q=a%3Afire+def%3A200"><code>a:fire def:200</code></a></li>
  <li>All “Blue-eyes” fusion monsters except the ones that are level 12: <a href="/?q=c%3Afusion+l%21%3D12+blue-eyes"><code>t:fusion l!=12 blue-eyes</code></a></li>
  <li>All Synchro monsters that are Dark attribute, level 5 or higher, and have exactly 2200 ATK: <a href="/?q=t%3Asynchro+a%3Adark+l%3E%3D5+atk%3A2200"><code>t:synchro a:dark l>=5 atk:2200</code></a></li>
  <li>All counter traps that can negate summons: <a href="/?q=t%3Atrap+t%3Acounter+e%3A%22negate+the+summon%22"><code>t:trap t:counter e:"negate the summon"</code></a></li>
  <li>All effect monsters printed in Legend of Blue-Eyes: <a href="/?q=set%3Alob+t%3Aeffect"><code>set:lob t:effect</code></a></li>
  <li>All Zoodiac cards that are currently banned: <a href="/?q=legal%3A0+zoodiac"><code>legal:0 zoodiac</code></a></li>
  <li>All chaos-type effect monsters that are level 6 or 8: <a href="/?q=a%3Alight%7Cdark+t%3Aeffect+l%3A6%7C8"><code>a:light|dark t:effect l:6|8</code></a></li>
</ul>
